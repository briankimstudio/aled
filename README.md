# ALED

ALED is a program to control "unaddressable" RGB led strip control platform. After reading about WLED project, I found out that WLED is for "addressable" RGB led strip. That is why I started this project.

## Current status

A user can control led strip via ESP32 web interface.

## Todo

- Add WiFiManager for manage SSID easily.
- Switch color wheel interface for more function or control.

Any suggestions will be welcomed.

Hope you enjoy it.
